# pinator-qmk-keymap

This is my personal keymap for the great [Piantor Keyboard](https://github.com/beekeeb/piantor). It is based on the [Bone Layout](https://www.neo-layout.org/Layouts/bone/) which I adapted to my needs. It is definitely a work in progress as I just started learning the new layout. For this I use <https://www.keybr.com> which is great for starting a new layout as you start with a limited number of keys and increase over time.
